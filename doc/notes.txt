Design decisions
-------------------------------

*General*

* The bridge design pattern is used in many places. This is good because it seperates implementation, and we get pimpl for free.

*Reads*

How to represent an abstract read is a difficult design choice. They are accessed so often we don't want
to introduce any abstraction that could impeed performance. My take is:

a) Some data is either very stable (sequence qualities), or is never going to change (the sequence).
b) Some data is dependent on current sequencing technology (mate-pair information).
c) Some data is dependent on other factors (mapping quality, duplicate marking).

I've tried to keep this design as independent as possible from the Samtools specification,
but given its prevalent use, it has obviously influenced the design a lot.
